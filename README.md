Colony Coalition - 

This game started out as a project for the Microsoft Imagine Cup. It then floundered around until the team members realized there was no chance that they would ever actually complete the game in time. 

The game has a potentially interesting gameplay mechanic - each player controls one turrent and one end of the ship. They must cooperate to pilot the ship through a dangerous asteroid field.

Currently the parts that need fixing are the bullets, the shield graphics, and collision. Once those are done there will be a semi-usable game. Unfortunately turning on the shield graphics seems to make lots of other stuff stop working.
